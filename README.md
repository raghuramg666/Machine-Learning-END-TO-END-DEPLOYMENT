# End-to-End Machine Learning Model Deployment: A Complete Guide

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and practical implementation for deploying a machine learning model from initial data analysis to final model training and prediction. The project is structured to offer insights at every step, ensuring you can replicate or adapt the processes for your use case.

## Project Structure

- artifacts/: Contains the raw and processed training datasets.
- notebook/: Jupyter notebooks detailing the steps from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training:
  - 1 . EDA STUDENT PERFORMANCE.ipynb: Dive into the data to understand the variables influencing student performance.
  - 2. MODEL TRAINING.ipynb: Details the training process, including parameter tuning and model selection.
- src/: Python modules organized to support different components of the ML pipeline:
  - components/: Modules for data ingestion, transformation, and model training.
  - pipeline/: Implementation of the training and prediction pipelines.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Machine-Learning-END-TO-END-DEPLOYMENT-main
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the model training pipeline, navigate to the project directory and execute:

```bash
python src/pipeline/train_pipeline.py
```

For making predictions using the trained model:

```bash
python src/pipeline/predict_pipeline.py
```
